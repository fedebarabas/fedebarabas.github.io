Wrote an [open-source analysis tool](projects/#gollum) in Python that enabled automated and unbiased quantification of structures in biological images. I also developed a [modular control software](projects/#tormenta) to integrate lasers, cameras and other devices into automated smart microscopes.

Excited about data science, visualization and machine learning methods. Learning every day from Kaggle and Coursera.

### Bio

I got my Licenciate and PhD degrees from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
For my Licenciate thesis I studied the counting statistical efficiency of muon detectors for the [Pierre Auger Observatory](https://www.auger.org/).
For my PhD thesis at the [Applied Nanophysics Group](http://www.nano.df.uba.ar/), [CIBION](http://www.cibion-conicet.gob.ar/?lan=en), I designed and built a localization fluorescence microscope, capable of acquiring images of biological samples at the nanometric scale.
Now working as a postdoc researcher at [TestaLab](http://testalab.org/), [SciLifeLab](http://www.scilifelab.se/) in Stockholm. Here, we devise new ways of looking at cellular structures beyond the current limits in the spatial and temporal domains.
