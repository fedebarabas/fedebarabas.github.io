I analyze imaging data by building custom tools that I share with the research community. I also write open-source code to integrate lasers, cameras and other devices into automated smart microscopes. 

Excited about data science, visualization and machine learning methods. Currently taking [Andrew Ng's specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) and [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai/) deep learning courses.

### Bio

I got my Licenciate and PhD degrees from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. For my Licenciate thesis I studied the counting efficiency of muon detectors for the [Pierre Auger Observatory](https://www.auger.org/). For my PhD thesis at the [Applied Nanophysics Group](http://www.nano.df.uba.ar/), [CIBION](http://www.cibion-conicet.gob.ar/?lan=en), I designed and built a localization fluorescence microscope, capable of acquiring images of biological samples at the nanometric scale. Now working as a postdoc researcher at [TestaLab](http://testalab.org/), [SciLifeLab](http://www.scilifelab.se/) in Stockholm. Here, we devise new ways of looking at cellular structures beyond the current limits in the spatial and temporal domains.
